## 🛠️ **Key Concepts**

### 🔹 1. Simple Current Mirror (MOSFET-Based)
- Utilizes **two MOSFETs** in a basic setup.
- **Pros:** Simple to implement.
- **Cons:** Channel length modulation reduces accuracy due to **lower output resistance**.

### 🔹 2. Wilson Current Mirror (MOSFET-Based)
- Incorporates **negative feedback** to stabilize output. 🔄
- Uses **three MOSFETs**, providing **higher output impedance** and better accuracy.
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more complex design.

### 🔹 3. Cascode Current Mirror (MOSFET-Based)
- Combines mirroring with a **cascode setup** using **four MOSFETs**.
- **Pros:** Very high output resistance & precision. 🎯
- **Cons:** Introduces **voltage headroom limitations**.

### 🔹 4. Low Voltage Cascode Current Mirror (MOSFET-Based)
- **Optimized for low supply voltage**, solving headroom issues of traditional cascode designs. ⚡
- Ideal for **low-power, low-voltage applications**.
- **Challenge:** Increased layout complexity due to multiple MOSFETs. 🏗️

## 📊 **Transient Analysis**

📌 **Simple Current Mirror** → Fast response but **notable deviations** due to lower output resistance.

📌 **Wilson Current Mirror** → Better **load regulation & stability**, but slightly slower response. ⚖️

📌 **Cascode Current Mirror** → **High accuracy, minimal output variation**, but the **slowest response** due to parasitics. 🛑

📌 **Low Voltage Cascode Current Mirror** → **Similar performance** to the cascode but optimized for **lower voltages** with high precision. 🔍
